An app for getting the values of some crypto currencies in real currencies.

This app uses api call to coinapi.io to get conversion rates from fiat currency to actual currency. A dropdown list allows the user to use actual currency.
I mostly used previously learned concepts here but for the first time I used the dart:io module to find out which platform the app is running on; if it is iOS then CupertinoIcon is displayed and if it is any other platform then Material app dropdown button is displayed.
